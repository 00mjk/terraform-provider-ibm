## 1.2.2 (February 26, 2020)

ENHANCEMENTS:

* resource/ibm_is_vpc: Improved error message for VPC creation ([#1106](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/terraform-provider-ibm/pull/1106))

* resource/ibm_container_cluster : Added gateway feature support for IKS clusters. This feature helps to create a cluster with a gateway worker pool of two gateway worker nodes that are connected to public and private VLANs to provide limited public access, and a compute worker pool of compute worker nodes that are connected to the private VLAN only. 
([#1125](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/terraform-provider-ibm/pull/1125))
* data/ibm_conatiner_cluster_config : Extended the data source to provide additional attribute like admin_key, admin_certificate, ca_certificate, host and token. This attributes helps to connect to other providers like Kubernetes and Helm without loading cluster config file. ([#895](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/terraform-provider-ibm/issues/895))
